# 🤖 MTI Machine Learning Guide 📚

Welcome to the MTI Machine Learning Guide! This repository is a comprehensive guide designed to help engineers leverage machine learning to solve real-world problems related to data center operations. By applying machine learning techniques, we can improve business value, enhance security, and overcome loss.

Data centers are often subject to cyber attacks and infrastructure failures. Maintaining high availability of both infrastructure and applications is a constant challenge. This guide aims to provide practical solutions to these problems using machine learning.

## 🎯 What's Inside?

This guide is structured as follows:

1. **Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data**: We start by tackling anomaly detection problems in time series data, a common issue in data center operations. This includes detecting anomalies in CPU utilization, which can be an early indicator of potential issues.

The guide includes:

- 📂 A collection of Jupyter notebooks with code examples and explanations.
- 📝 Detailed guides and tutorials on various machine learning techniques.
- 🌐 Resources for further learning and exploration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this guide, you'll need to:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks.
